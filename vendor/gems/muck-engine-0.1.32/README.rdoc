= MuckEngine

The muck engine is forms the basis for the muck framework and includes basic functionality utilized by the various muck engines.

The easiest way to get started with muck is to generate your application using a template:
  $ rails <your-app> -m http://github.com/jbasdf/rails-templates/raw/master/muck.rb

Add optional functionality with the following command:
  $ rake rails:template LOCATION=http://github.com/jbasdf/rails-templates/raw/master/mucktoo.rb

== Installation

  sudo gem install mislav-will_paginate -s 'http://gems.github.com'
  
  sudo gem install muck-engine

== Setup
Be sure to include the muck_engine tasks in your Rakefile:

  require 'muck_engine'
  require 'muck_engine/tasks'

Add a method to application_controller.rb that will determine which users have access to the admin section of the website

  # called by Admin::Muck::BaseController to check whether or not the
  # user should have access to the admin UI
  def admin_access_required
    access_denied unless admin?
  end

Muck provides a number of methods that can set the current locale.  Add a before filter and method to application_controller.rb
  before_filter :set_locale

Add a set_locale method:
  def set_locale
    discover_locale
  end

The set_locale method can use discover_locale to try various methods of finding the proper locale or it can call any of the methods individually:
  def discover_locale
    I18n.locale = extract_locale_from_tld || extract_locale_from_subdomain || extract_locale_from_headers || extract_locale_from_user_selection || extract_locale_from_browser || I18n.default_locale
  end
  
== Usage
  If your application includes a locale switching menu, you would then have something like this in it:
  link_to("Deutsch", "#{APP_CONFIG[:deutsch_website_url]}#{request.env['REQUEST_URI']}") 
  
== Layout

The muck template will build your basic application and construct all the needed files and configuration.

If you build your own layout be sure to include the following script in your layout or the javascript in the system won't work:
  <script type="text/javascript" language="JavaScript">
    <%= yield :javascript %>
  </script>

You can customize your email template by overriding the existing layouts.  Simply add email_default.text.html.erb and email_default.text.plain.erb
views/layouts.  This will build templates for html and plain text emails.  For an example of each look at the views/layouts directory in this project.

== CSS

The css provided by the muck engine comes from blueprint:

We've also included a liquid version:
