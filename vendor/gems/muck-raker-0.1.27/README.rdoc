= Muck Raker
Muck Raker adds functionality that aggregates, searches and analyzes data from many different web sources.

== Installation

Be sure to add github as a gem source before proceeding as acts-as-taggable-on, mislav-will_paginate (and many other gems) live there.
  gem sources -a http://gems.github.com

Install muck raker:
  sudo gem install muck-raker
  
Installing muck raker should install all of it's dependancies.  You can also install them manually:
  sudo gem install httparty
  sudo gem install mbleigh-acts-as-taggable-on
  sudo gem install mislav-will_paginate
  sudo gem install muck-feedbag
  sudo gem install pauldix-feedzirra

After install acts-as-taggable-on be sure to include the helper in application_helper.rb:

  module ApplicationHelper
    include TagsHelper
  end

Add rake tasks to your Rakefile

  require 'muck_raker/tasks'

Add routes
Depending on which features you use from muck raker you may need to add additional routes to your application.  For example, 
a user with has_muck_feeds and acts_as_muck_feed_owner the following routes would be required:

  map.resources :users, :controller => 'muck/users' do |users|
    # have to map into the muck/identity_feeds controller or rails can't find the identity_feeds
    users.resources :identity_feeds, :controller => 'muck/identity_feeds'
    users.resources :feeds, :controller => 'muck/feeds'
  end

== Usage
Muck raker aggregates data feeds and analyzes the results to make recommendations.

=== environment.rb
Add the following to environment.rb to include all the required gems:

config.gem "muck-feedbag", :lib => "feedbag", :source => "http://gems.github.com"
config.gem "pauldix-feedzirra", :lib => 'feedzirra', :source => "http://gems.github.com"
config.gem 'muck-engine', :lib => 'muck_engine'
config.gem 'muck-users', :lib => 'muck_users'
config.gem 'muck-solr', :lib => 'acts_as_solr'
# The following are optional but almost always used so you may as well pull them in.
config.gem 'muck-comments', :lib => 'muck_comments'
config.gem 'muck-activities', :lib => 'muck_activities'
config.gem 'muck-shares', :lib => 'muck_shares'



=== Identity Feeds
Specific feeds can be attached to objects.  For example, a user might produce a blog or a flickr photo stream.  The identity feed system associated the resulting
data with the user so that recommendations can be improved.

== Notes
muck-raker uses muck-comments and muck-activities to add comments to entries in the 'visits' frame view.  You can omit these gems if you don't desire comments.
muck-raker also uses muck-shares and muck-activities to share entries with other users.  Again you can omit these gems if you don't desire the share capability.

To turn on this functionality add these lines to your global_config.yml file:
  enable_raker_comments: true
  enable_raker_shares: true

To install these gems:
  sudo gem install muck-comments
  sudo gem install muck-activities
  sudo gem install muck-shares

If you enable comments you will need a comment model with 'acts_as_muck_raker_comment':

class Comment < ActiveRecord::Base
  acts_as_muck_comment
  acts_as_muck_raker_comment
end

=== Frame css
There is an example css file for the framed page in frame.css.

=== Testing
You will need to have mysql setup to run the migrations for the test database.  Muck raker has a few customizations which require mysql.
